		I used Weebly for my capstone project last semester. It has a very nice GUI for dragging and dropping different elements of a website. It is very easy to add dropdown menus and new pages.  Most of the services are free but if you subscribe to them you can add more pages to your site and a few other nifty features.  Weebly hosts sites so originialy we were trying to host our site with them and not use it as a development service, but they donâ€™t support any php so we exported the CSS and html and JavaScript from the site and uploaded it to daddy which did support or needs.
